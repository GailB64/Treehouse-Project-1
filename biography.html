    <main>
        <p>Gail Bartik was raised in southeast Wisconsin.  She obtained a BS in Art from the University
        of Wisconsin-Madison. Gail went on to earn an MFA in Arts Administration from the University of
        Utah. Her MFA was unique. Through a university-sponsored internship, she worked with the Sundance
        Institute for Film and Television for the first two years of its inception. The exposure to and 
        development of story for film has influenced her approach and conception of visual art.</p> 

        <p>While working in marketing and fundraising for nonprofit arts organizations, Gail continued 
        her study of drawing and printmaking at the Art Student’s League of New York, where she was 
        awarded a Nessa Cohen Scholarship. She was an artist in residence at the Eugene O’Neill 
        Theatre Center in Waterford, CT.  Following four plays through their development process, 
        Gail created a body of visual artwork for each experience. Work from the project was exhibited 
        at Lincoln Center in New York City.</p>
        
        <p>Gail has worked at Hunter College in New York City as Ceramic Studio Manager, at the 
        Anderson Ranch Arts Center in Snowmass Village, Colorado as a Painting Assistant in the Summer 
        Workshop Program and has taught at Colorado Mountain College in Aspen, Colorado.</p>
