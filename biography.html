    <h1>Gail Bartik Biography</h1>
<main>
    <p>Gail Bartik was raised in southeast Wisconsin.  She obtained a BS in Art from the University
     of Wisconsin-Madison. Gail went on to earn an MFA in Arts Administration from the University of
     Utah. Her MFA was unique. Through a university-sponsored internship, she worked with the Sundance
     Institute for Film and Television for the first two years of its inception. The exposure to and 
     development of story for film has influenced her approach and conception of visual art.</p> 

    <p>While working in marketing and fundraising for nonprofit arts organizations, Gail continued 
    her study of drawing and printmaking at the Art Student’s League of New York where she was 
    awarded a Nessa Cohen Scholarship. She was an artist in residence at the Eugene O’Neill 
    Theatre Center in Waterford, CT. Following four plays through their development process, 
    Gail created a body of visual artwork for each experience. Work from the project was exhibited 
    at Lincoln Center in New York City.</p>
    
    <p>Gail has worked at Hunter College in New York City as the Ceramic Studio manager, at the 
    Anderson Ranch Arts Center in Snowmass Village, Colorado as Painting Assistant in the Summer 
    Workshop Program and has taught at Colorado Mountain College in Aspen, Colorado.</p>
